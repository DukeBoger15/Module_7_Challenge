# Module_7_Challenge
This repo contains my FinTech Bootcamp Module 7 Challenge code.
In this challenge we built a financial database and a web application by using SQL, python and the Voila library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

HOW TO USE/DEPLOY CODE/JUYPTER LAB 
To use this application, please clone the repo and open a Juypter Lab notebook. Upon launching the application in the Juypter Lab notebook, run the file, from the run tab and select "Run All Cells"

HOW TO USE/DEPLOY THE WEB APPLICATION 
To deploy the Juypter notebook as a web application, deployed locally on your computer, complete the following steps. 
Step 1: Run the command "voila etf_analyzer.ipynb" in the gitbash/terminal After running the commnd, you should be directed to a new tab in your internet browser with a localhost web address. This page is the SQL code application running in the web browser.
